This is an API wrapper for Shotgun. This wrapper should be used by scripts that
are only quickly connecting, making a query and then disconnecting. It provides
a massive speed improvement of 10 to 100 times that of the regular Shotgun API.

The regular Shotgun API can be slow at times. When starting up a tool that is
initializing a Shotgun object, it can add anywhere from .5 to 5 seconds onto
the startup time. Once connected, however, talking to the database can be quite
fast. This can cause a huge annoyance for tools that simply need to connect to
grab one piece of data and then disconnect. Think along the lines of setting a
shot's frame range upon opening a Maya file.

This wrapper is actually quite simple. Using the knowledge above that Shotgun
can be slow to connect, but quite speedy once connected, we have simply removed
the requirement of making a new connection every single time. We can create a
single connection to the Shotgun database and leave it connected at all times.
We then also open up a socket. Our wrapper, which looks exactly like the regular
Shotgun API, also takes a host and port argument. Rather than establishing a new
connection using the regular method included in the Shotgun object, it connects
to that socket. Then, when we send requests to Shotgun, those requests are sent
through the socket to the existing Shotgun connection, it quickly does the query
and then sends the results back through.
